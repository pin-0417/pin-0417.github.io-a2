        Yehezkel Raz presents an album of pristine Classical Piano compositions
        played masterfully, delving into a vast array of moods, including
        Dramatic, Uplifting, Serious, Carefree and Love. It's obvious after the
        first few seconds that we're listening to pure, unbridled talent and
        emotion at the highest level.
